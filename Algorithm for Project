Step 1: Start
Initialize the system.

Import all necessary Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, and streamlit.

Step 2: Load the Dataset
Load cardiovascular disease data from a CSV file using pandas.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing
Check for and handle missing or null values.

Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding.

Normalize/standardize numerical features for consistent model input using StandardScaler.

Step 4: Feature Selection
Analyze correlations and domain knowledge to select important features (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol).

Define input features (X) and output target (y).

Step 5: Dataset Splitting
Split the dataset into training set (80%) and testing set (20%) using train_test_split() for model validation.

Step 6: Model Selection
Select machine learning classifiers for prediction:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

Step 7: Model Training
Train both models using the training dataset.

Step 8: Model Evaluation
Evaluate both models on the test dataset using metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-score

Step 9: Build the Front-End (Streamlit)
Use the Streamlit framework to design a web-based user interface.

Create an interactive layout for the user to input health-related parameters.

Step 10: Accept User Inputs
Collect health inputs from the user such as:

Age

Gender

Systolic/Diastolic blood pressure

Glucose level

Cholesterol level

Weight and Height

Step 11: Preprocess User Input
Normalize and encode the user input in the same way as the training data.

Reshape and prepare the input for prediction.

Step 12: Make Prediction
Feed the processed user input to the trained models.

Generate the probability or classification of cardiovascular risk.

Step 13: Display Results
Show the user:

Whether they are at risk of cardiovascular disease or not.

The probability/percentage of risk.

Suggestions for maintaining a healthy lifestyle (optional).

Step 14: End
End the program once results are displayed and feedback is given.
