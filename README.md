ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The Multiple Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based web application designed to predict the risk of critical health conditions like Heart Disease and Diabetes using clinical data provided by the user.

This project integrates trained models (SVC and Logistic Regression) with a Streamlit-powered interface to deliver real-time health predictions in a simple and interactive format. The system aims to promote early detection, preventive healthcare, and health awareness among users through data-driven insights.

ðŸ”‘ Key Highlights:
Dual Prediction System: Supports both Heart Disease and Diabetes predictions.

ML Integration: Uses Support Vector Classifier and Logistic Regression for accurate classification.

Streamlit Frontend: Offers a clean, fast, and interactive user interface to input health parameters and get immediate results.

Preprocessed Dataset: Uses cleaned and scaled health datasets from reliable sources like Kaggle.

Model Evaluation: Includes performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Personalized Output: Displays disease prediction along with possible risk level (e.g., High Heart Risk, Non-Diabetic).
